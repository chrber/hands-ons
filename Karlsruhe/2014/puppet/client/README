To configure a new user in a client machine you have 
run the script in the right sequence:

1- source setupPuppetClient.sh 
   this will install the last version of puppet client
   and will configure the client to be attached to the master
   During the first connection the client will genrate a certificate
   which need to be signed by the master.

2- source addNewUser.sh -u username -e
   this will setup the user for gitolite and the puppet env in the puppet.conf
   It will create also the key pairs.
   Do not forget to give the public key to the gitolite admin
