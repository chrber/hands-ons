# This is the main configuration file of dCache.
#
# This file used to be called config/dCacheSetup, but is now stored in
# etc/dcache.conf. Documentation may still refer to it as
# config/dCacheSetup. Most of the parameters are the same and the
# documentation also applies to this file.
#
# By default the file is empty. Default values are picked up from the
# properties files in share/defaults/. Do not modify the defaults
# files: any changes will be lost when upgrading. Instead override the
# defaults by redefining the parameters in this file.
