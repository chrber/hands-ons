# Pools
---

Quite easy, as it does not really matter if pools are offline for a view minutes.

# Doors
---

 * Create several doors for the same protocol
 * Disable one door, after it has not active transfers any longer
 * Update the door
 * Enable the door 


# Core Services
---

* As Gerd said, poolmanager and pnfsmanager can not really be updated without expert knowledge at the moment without interruption
